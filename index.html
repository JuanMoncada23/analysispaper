<h1>Juan's Analysis Paper</h1>
<p>Introduction</p> 

<pre>
    For my architectural analysis I decided to research on React. 
    I chose React because it is something I am fairly new with and I would like to learn more about it and how I can better utilize React down the road in my career and even as a student. 
    I also choose React because I feel it is one of the easier ways to make changes in the browser DOM without having to go manipulating the browser’s DOM directly. 
    A third reason why I chose React is because it is JavaScript based, and we do must of our web coding in JavaScript so it will for sure help me in the long run especially when it comes to my final project in this class.
    The way I think React is going to fit into my final project is that React is all about reusing code and if I do not want to rewrite a line of code, I can just reference it back to the first time I mention it. Not only saving me time but also less code. 
    Another way React is going to fit in my final project is that instead of having to go back and reloading my browser the webpage itself will update as soon as I make the necessary changes in my files and save it. 
    React is also event friendly meaning it has the same events as HTML: click, change, mouseover etc. 
    Making it easy for me to implement features on my webpage without having to worry that I can not add a button or click on something etc.
    The way React is going to fit into our Saas platform is that we can introduce React as another way to create our webpages and easier to maintain since when we make changes in our files, we see the updated version right away after saving it versus having to reload the browser. 
    Plus React goes hand in hand with JavaScript and HTML so learning it wouldn’t be too hard.
